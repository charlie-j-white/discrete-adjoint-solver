# Discrete Adjoint Solver

By Charlie Anderson for the UoB AEng Final Year Project module


## Compile instructions

This program can easily be compiled on an up to date Linux system. Just follow the steps - 

Step 1: $ make

Step 2: Sort out the inevitable errors. This will need gfortran which can easily be installed through the command line, and LAPack, try "$ sudo pacman -S lapack" or something.

Step 3: $ ./main

That's it! I'll update this file later probably
